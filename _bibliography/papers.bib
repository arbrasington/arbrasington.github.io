   abstract = {Automated fiber placement (AFP) is a composite manufacturing technique used to fabricate complex advanced air vehicle structures that are lightweight with superior qualities. The AFP process is intricate and complex with various phases of design, process planning, manufacturing, and inspection. An understanding of each of these phases is necessary to achieve the highest possible manufacturing quality. This literature review aims to summarize the entire AFP process from the design of the structure through inspection of the manufactured part to generate an overall understanding of the lifecycle of AFP manufacturing.

   abstract = {Automated fiber placement (AFP) manufacturing with carbon fiber composites is becoming increasingly popular in manufacturing sectors. Since its inceptions, this technique has been mainly used for simple geometries; however, research has led to the possibility of increasingly complex structures. One such type of complex geometry to be investigated is a strut. Struts are largely seen in structures such as lunar landers and aircraft. The layup of such a complex geometry produces defects that can hinder the structural performance of the final part. This report investigates the manufacturability of such a geometry by investigating the geometry and path planning combined with a tool to rapidly iterate on the design variables. The result is a strut geometry optimal for limiting defects with predicted manufacturability scores displaying potential issues that could be seen in the manufacturing process.},

   abstract = {This study aims to investigate the induced effects on the temperature requirements due to the use of a complex geometry, while also gathering data for two types of materials supplied by Toray Industries. Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) has been sweeping the composites manufacturing industry due to its ability to manufacture parts with high speed, repeatability, and process quality. As a result of the advancement of the machines' capabilities, it is being used to manufacture parts with higher degrees of complexity. The effect of the shape's complexity on process parameters, namely temperature, is not well understood. Experiments consists of using zero- A nd ninety-degree constant angle layups on a complex tool to thoroughly examine the effect of curvature on the AFP process. Results show that material selection is vital to ensure high quality parts because of the difficulties with adhesion to the complex surface. Repeated layups indicate that an increase in temperature is necessary in concave areas to overcome bridging and steering defects. Heater deviation can also vary and will result in local increases and decreases in temperature. All of these effects must be accounted for when process planning, and should be monitored during AFP manufacturing to ensure high quality parts.},

Currently, the process is black box where paths and process parameters are sent to the machine, and it is trusted to maintain the correct values. There are limited methods of monitoring real time process parameter values for current and future analyzing. Even when the exact same parameters are used on the same part multiple times, the resulting manufacturing quality can differ largely. This report will discuss the creation of a digital twin with the capability to simulate and monitor the entire AFP process. A digital twin will provide the ability to examine the process in real time, in addition to after the process is completed. The data collected will then be compared to expected data to examine any differences. Analysis of each point during manufacturing will lead to a deeper understanding of AFP.},

   abstract = {Since the arrival of Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) in the 1980s and 1990s, the manufacturing technique has been progressively improving in quality and reliability of the process and resulting structures. The state-of-the-art of AFP is allowing for the manufacture of structures with increasing geometrical complexity. To adequately manufacture such structures, a large effort in process planning is required to reduce defect occurrence to the best extent possible. Many optimization methodologies have been established for AFP in terms of the design and process parameters. However, limited work has been accomplished in terms of process planning optimization. The work presented in the latter will develop a Bayesian Optimization (BO) technique for the optimization of process planning with the use of the Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) software and its connection with Vericut Composite Programming (VCP). A case study is performed on a doubly curved tool surface and the optimal solution is compared with as-manufactured results for validation. A predictive tool is also developed to rank layup strategies based on defect importance. Results show a substantial improvement in defect occurrence and allow a process planner to immediately see the performance of various layup strategies and starting point combinations.},

   abstract = {As the world of automated composites manufacturing continues to mature, Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) is proving to be a standout option for the manufacturing of large and complex structures. However, even with the recent advances in the AFP process, unavoidable defects still occur because of tool surface geometry, placement errors, or poor process planning. Defects can be minimized in the process planning phase by optimizing the selection of input parameters such as starting points, layup strategies, and tows per course. This input selection is typically done by hand with a seemingly infinite number of possibilities when considering all possible combinations of inputs, combined with expensive computational costs and a "black box" evaluation function. Such an optimization problem lends itself to the use of surrogate-based methods. The presented research evaluates multiple surrogate models for ply-by-ply starting point and layup strategy optimization. Each of the models' performances are summarized, along with demonstrating the rapid nature of such an optimization technique when compared with other gradient-free options. Selected methods are used to optimize ply angles of 0, 45,-45, and 90 degrees on a doubly curved surface to evaluate the results of the optimization.},

   abstract = {Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) is an advanced manufacturing technique for industrial-scale composite structures. When using AFP, there are a multitude of inputs and factors that can impact the final quality of the structure. To ensure interlaminar strength and optimal interface between the incoming tows and the substrate, the AFP head utilizes a heating element to induce resin tackiness. Attempts at modeling heat within AFP currently utilize physics and multiphysics-based modeling (PBM) strategies. However, PBM often falls short due to the interactions of countless parameters and prevalence of unknown variables, namely material related. This paper will present a hybridized temperature model for AFP, where data-driven modeling (DDM) predicts the applied temperature informing PBM methods for evaluation of temperature distribution and evolution. Data will be collected through experimentation for development of the models and a virtual case-study will be performed to assess the validity of the DDM and the full hybridized physics-data model. To demonstrate the benefits of such an integration, a case-study is executed on a complex curvature tool.},

   abstract = {As a contribution towards developing a platform for the mechanical characterization and eventual certification of steered fiber laminates, this paper presents a methodical breakdown of principal considerations. It is acknowledged that the synthesis of such a laminate will introduce curvilinear fibers that would result in a spatial variation in fiber orientation, which is one of the main characteristics that define the response of steered fiber laminates. The other important factors are identified as the presence of gaps and overlaps. Subsequently, the current publication proposes that these main characteristics interact to produce significantly complex stress-states in steered fiber laminates. By comparing the characteristics of steered fiber laminates with those of conventional laminates and laminates with ply drops, it is deduced that significant interlaminar stresses would develop especially at high stress gradient regions such as gaps and overlaps. Research on the examination of the effect of the principal factors – fiber orientation, interlaminar stresses, gaps and overlaps, are discussed in the context of the characterization and certification. For every principal factor, corresponding discussions are constructed by a review of literature firstly regarding their nature and existing methods for quantifying them, and secondly related to their implementation in characterization frameworks.},

   abstract = {As the world of composites manufacturing evolves and moves toward more advanced automation, Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) continues to prove itself as one of the best options for manufacturing large and complex composite structures. When using AFP, there are a myriad of inputs and factors that can impact the final quality of the structure. One of the key factors in impacting potential defects is having consistent and uniform compaction along a given toolpath. To achieve this, the behavior of the compaction roller needs to be characterized under AFP loading conditions. A series of static loading tests are carried out to determine the roller deflection, contact area, and compression when deformed as function of the input compaction force. The collected data is then integrated into a predictive algorithm to evaluate the pressure distribution along the toolpaths and throughout a complex ply surface. Information from the model can then be incorporated back into the process planning stage of AFP to minimize possible defects that are generated by improper compaction.},

   abstract = {Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) is a composite manufacturing technique utilized to create advanced, industrial-scale composite structures. Despite its powerful capabilities, a lack of supervision during manufacturing allows machine deviations to occur undetected. Additionally, the current AFP workflow is an open-loop cycle, where data is siloed and analyzed within each phase. Digital twin concepts can be utilized to not only remove the black box nature of AFP manufacturing but also represent and analyze all phases in the AFP lifecycle. In this paper, additional functionalities are implemented into an existing digital shadow to enable a comprehensive virtual manufacturing environment for AFP. 3D scanning methods are used to validate the layout of the cell. Reconstructed paths using machine data and motion capture are compared to expected paths to investigate machine motion and kinematic accuracy. To create an environment to study the lifecycle, analyses from different phases throughout the AFP workflow are imported into the shadow. Ply tool paths, initial defect predictions, compaction pressure modeling, and as-manufactured defects are projected back onto the tool surface. The presented shadow provides an updated virtual manufacturing environment with a novel framework for investigating and analyzing the entire AFP workflow.},

   abstract = {It is widely thought that considerable manual rework is a necessity in the production of aerospace composite structures manufactured through automated fiber placement (AFP). However, there is limited availability of information regarding the precise quality control outcomes obtained through manual rework and defect removal. Given the large amounts of cycle time dedicated to the rework process, it may be fruitful to investigate in what ways rework may improve part quality, shift defect distributions, or in some cases, fail at improvement and make the resulting structure worse. To provide insights into these questions, a ply of a doubly-curved part was produced by AFP, inspected using an automated inspection system, manually repaired, and then inspected again. Through a multi-faceted analysis of the inspection data, trends including changes in defect number and significance, repair suggestions, and a previously unreported new defect type associated with manual rework can be observed.},
